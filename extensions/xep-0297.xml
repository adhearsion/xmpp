    	<p>Added recommendation that forwarded messages as part of another specification should be nested under an
    	   element of that protocol's namespace.</p>
    	<p>Adapted text to indicate that stanzas other than messages may be forwarded. Updated title to reflect this.</p>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>There are many situations is which an entity needs to forward a previously sent stanza to another entity, such as forwarding an interesting message to a friend, or a server forwarding stored messages from an archive. Here we specify a simple encapsulation method for such forwards. This format can be used in other specifications requiring the forwarding of stanzas, or used in isolation for a user to forward a message to another user (rather like email forwards).</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='requirements'>
  <p>Several properties are desirable when forwarding stanzas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The original sender and receiver should be identified.</li>
    <li>Extension payloads should be included (not only a message &lt;body/&gt;</li>
    <li>It should be possible to annotate the stanza (e.g. with a timestamp) without ambiguity as to the original stanza contents.</li>
    <li>It should allow features such as encryption or signing of the original stanza to survive the forwarding.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let us suppose that a Romeo receives a message from Juliet:</p>
    <example caption='Receiving a message'><![CDATA[
      <message from='juliet@capulet.lit/orchard'
               id='0202197'
               to='romeo@montague.lit'
               type='chat'>
        <body>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.</body>
        <mood xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/mood'>
            <amorous/>
        </mood>
      </message>
    ]]></example>
    
  <p>To forward this to Mercutio, Romeo would send a new message with a &lt;forwarded/&gt; payload of namespace 'urn:xmpp:forward:0'.</p>
    <example caption='Forwarding a message'><![CDATA[
      <message to='mercutio@verona.lit' from='romeo@montague.lit/orchard' type='chat' id='28gs'>

  <section2 topic='Business rules'>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Forwarded stanzas SHOULD include all relevant child elements of the original stanza by default.
          However, an implementation MAY omit elements it deems irrelevant and safe to discard. An example
          would be omitting &xep0085; elements from &lt;message&gt; stanzas which typically do not make sense
          outside the context of a conversation session. However it should be noted that removing such
          elements can invalidate any digital signature on a stanza. If preserving a signature is important
          in the context this extension is used then child elements SHOULD NOT be removed.</p></li>
      <li><p>The forwarding entity SHOULD add a &lt;delay/&gt; child to the &lt;forwarded/&gt; element
          to indicate to the recipient the date/time that the forwarding entity received the original
          stanza. The format of this element is described in &xep0203;.</p></li>
      <li><p>The namespace of the forwarded stanza MUST be preserved (this is typically 'jabber:client').
          If no 'xmlns' is set for the stanza then as per XML namespacing rules it would inherit the
          'urn:xmpp:forward:0' namespace, which is wrong.</p></li>
      <li><p>When this extension is employed simply for a user to forward a given message to a contact, the
          outer &lt;message/&gt; SHOULD contain a body (even if empty) and a receiving client should pay
          particular attention to ensure it renders both the sender's text and the forwarded message
          unambiguously.</p></li>
      <li><p>When a forwarded stanza forms part of an encapsulating protocol, the &lt;forwarded/&gt; element
          SHOULD be a child of a tag of that protocol, and SHOULD NOT be included as a direct child of the
          transmitted stanza.</p></li>
    </ol>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>Forwarding stanzas can reveal information about the original sender, including possible presence leaks as well as the stanza payloads themselves. Any extensions using this format must therefore consider the implications of this.</p>
  <p>Forwarding can either be used as-is, or in the context of another specification, with different security considerations as described below.</p>
  <section2 topic='As-is' anchor='as-is-sc'>
  <p>Receipt of a forwarded stanza from a third-party does not guarantee that the original stanza was actually received, or that the content has not been modified, by the forwarder. Integrity of the original stanza can only be determined through digital signing mechanisms such as described in &xep0285; and &xep0290;.</p>
  <p>Considering the above an end-user client should take special care in its rendering of forwarded stanzas, such as forwarded messages, to ensure that the user cannot mistake it for a message received directly from the original sender.</p>
  <p>An entity SHOULD NOT trust that forwards are genuine when receiving them unprovoked (i.e. outside the scope of another specification).</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Extensions' anchor='extensions-sc'>
  <p>While security considerations are ultimately dependent upon the specifications using the format defined herein, forwarding introduces scope for stanza forgery such that authors of derivative specifications will need to address security considerations themselves. These need to cover which entities a client should accept forwards from, and which entities those are permitted to forward stanzas for. For example, a specification may choose to only trust forwards if they are received from the user's client, another client on the bare JID, or the user's server.</p>
