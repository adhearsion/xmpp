	<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
		<p>Prior to this specification, membership applications have been relatively informal,
		and guidance has been similarly ad-hoc. This document provides the form of membership
		applications, which is part of the remit of the XSF Board.</p>
		<p>The intent is to provide as few rules as possible, but ensure that the XSF has the
		essential information required to make a decision on the application.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='Who May Apply' anchor='who'>
		<p>Although at the time this document was written, the XSF has only ever had
		"natural persons" - that is, ordinary people - apply
		for membership, the &BYLAWS; explicitly allow for corporate membership. In order to ensure
		the form of an application can satisfy this, this document will assume such applications may
		occur in the future.</p>
		<p>This document will distinguish requirements by using the term "Applicant" to mean either
		type, "Natural Applicant" for actual people, and "Corporate Applicant" for legal entities
		other than natural persons.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='Where Applications Are Submitted' anchor='submission'>
		<p>Applications are to be submitted as a new Wiki Page on the XSF Wiki,
		and linked from a single Wiki page which will be included in the
		announcement email sent by the XSF Secretary.</p>
		<p>Applicants are solely responsible for their own applications, and the applications shall be their own. Members and prospective members should not edit anyone else's application. Exceptions to this latter shall
		be made only with permission of the Board, the XSF Secretary, or the Executive Director; and
		the Applicant concerned.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='Challenges and Final Arbiter' anchor='arbiter'>
		<p>In the case that a particular application is questionable for some reason - if it is thought to be missing mandatory information or failing to disclose affiliations - a member may raise a Challenge with the membership, by sending a message to the members list detailing the issues. A member request a member of the &BOARD; to raise the Challenge anonymously on their behalf; the member of the Board however is in no way compelled to do so.</p>
		<p>The XSF Board is the final arbiter of such Challenges, and shall make a final decision on whether the application should be rejected; however the Board is expected to take into account any rough consensus of the members. Any rejection will include any remedies possible.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the final nature of the XSF Board's decision, any application so rejected may be resubmitted by the Applicant, presumably after addressing the issues.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='Mandatory Information' anchor='mandatory'>
		<p>The purpose of the mandatory information is to allow the XSF Secretary sufficient information to adhere to the XSF Bylaws. As a secondary purpose, it also allows the XSF members to make an informed decision when voting to accept applications; it is important for Applicants to understand that this mandatory information is unlikely to be sufficient to convince the members, however.</p>
		<section2 topic='All Applicants' anchor='mandatory-all'>
			<p>Applicants must provide:</p>
			<dl>
				<di><dt>Contact Email</dt><dd>A valid email address, specific to the Applicant, suitable for members to contact and request further information.</dd></di>
				<di><dt>Contact Jid</dt><dd>A valid jid, specific to the Applicant, suitable for members to contact and request further information.</dd></di>
			</dl>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Corporate Applicants' anchor='mandatory-corp'>
			<p>Corporate Applicants must provide:</p>
			<dl>
				<di><dt>Relevant Affiliations</dt><dd>Any further affiliations, as described within the final clause of the XSF Bylaws, Section 2.1. Note that Corporate Applicants will always be assumed to represent themselves, and may have no further affiliations.</dd></di>
				<di><dt>Legal Name</dt><dd>A full name by which the Applicant is known and identified for legal purposes. This could be the registered name of a Corporate Applicant.</dd></di>
				<di><dt>Relevant Trading Styles</dt><dd>Many jurisdictions have the notion of names under which a business typically operates. Names used by the Corporate Applicant for trading any XMPP related products or services must be included. There is no requirement herein to list all XMPP products or services.</dd></di>
			</dl>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Natural Applicants' anchor='mandatory-natural'>
			<p>Natural Applicants must provide:</p>
			<dl>

				<di><dt>Legal Name</dt><dd>A full name by which the Applicant is known and identified for legal purposes. This could be the name on a Natural Applicant's passport.</dd></di>
			</dl>
		</section2>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
		<p>There are privacy implications inherent in the public disclosure of the information in an Application, particularly by a Natural Applicant.</p>
		<p>These are an unavoidable consequence of the Application.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
		<p>This document has no considerations for IANA.</p>
	</section1>
	<section1 topic='XMPP Registrar Considerations' anchor='registrar'>
		<p>This document has no considerations for the XMPP Registrar.</p>
